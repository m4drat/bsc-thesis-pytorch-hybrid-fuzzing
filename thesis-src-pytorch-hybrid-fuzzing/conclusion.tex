\section{Conclusion}

The study conducted involved a comprehensive security analysis of PyTorch utilizing hybrid fuzzing techniques. As a result of the research, various fuzzing targets were developed, and multiple previously unknown bugs were identified and reported, all of which have been subsequently fixed.

In addition, performance enhancements were made to the hybrid fuzzing tool, \textit{sydr-fuzz}, developed by ISP RAS. These improvements included optimizing the security predicates verification stage and implementing a scheduling strategy for the memory modeling mode. The experimental results of the proposed enhancements showed a significant improvement in the overall performance, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations.

Future work may include further improvements to the hybrid fuzzing tool, such as implementing a more sophisticated scheduling strategy for the memory modeling mode. Besides improving the tool itself, it is also possible to extend the study to other deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow.
