\section{Conclusion}

Our study involved a comprehensive security analysis of PyTorch using hybrid fuzzing techniques. As a result of our work, we identified and reported multiple previously unknown bugs, all of which have since been fixed.

Besides that, we also improved the performance of \textit{sydr-fuzz}, a hybrid fuzzing tool developed by ISP RAS, by optimizing the security predicates verification stage and implementing a scheduling strategy for the memory modeling mode.

We believe that ensuring the security of critical software systems, such as PyTorch, is of paramount importance. We are optimistic that our research will pave the way for improved security measures in various software systems. Furthermore, we hope that our findings will inspire future research efforts in this area and lead to the development of better security practices and tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in complex software systems.
