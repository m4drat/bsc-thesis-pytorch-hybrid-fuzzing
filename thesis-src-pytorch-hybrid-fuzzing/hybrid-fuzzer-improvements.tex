\section{Hybrid Fuzzer Improvements}

During the fuzzing of the PyTorch various drawbacks were found.

In this section, we describe the improvements we made to the sydr-fuzz hybrid fuzzer. We begin by describing the changes we made to the symbolic execution engine to improve its performance. We then describe the changes we made to the scheduling symbolic pointers modelling to improve the coverage of the fuzzer. Finally, we describe how we utilized debug information to improve the performance of the fuzzer.

Verification is required to ensure that the module doesn't generate false-positives
