\section{Hybrid Fuzzer Improvements}

In this section, we describe the improvements we made to the sydr-fuzz hybrid fuzzer. We begin by describing the changes we made to the symbolic execution engine to improve its performance. We then describe the changes we made to the scheduling symbolic pointers modelling to improve the coverage of the fuzzer. Finally, we describe how we utilized debug information to improve the performance of the fuzzer.
